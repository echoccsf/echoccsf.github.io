        <h1>Elementary School of Potential Thrivers</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to the Elementary School of Potential Thrivers. We are a small school that offers learning in small classes with no more than 15 students per class. This creates a more personalized learning experience consisting of direct interaction with the teacher. Whenever the student is starting to show worsening performance in class, the student will work with the teacher to determine the cause of worsening performance and create solutions to improve academic performance. Since physical activity is important in academic performance, there will be physical education classes each day, so that the students will have the mental stamina to enhance learning. We hope to give your children the best and most successful academic learning experience in the near future.</p>
