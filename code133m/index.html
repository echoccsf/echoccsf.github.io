                Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are web applications that can be
                installed onto a device for offline use. They are created with the goal 
                of being quicker loading than a traditonal web application. PWAs are able 
                to load instantly, so that the user won't have a less-than-optimal 
                experience while they're being used. Since over half of internet users 
                tend to abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to use, the instant 
                loading proves vital if the company wants enough people to interact with 
                the app for a long enough time duration.

                Along with reliability, PWAs can also be installed without need to access 
                any sort of app store. Through manifest files, PWAs can also give 
                developers control on how the application appears once loaded, including 
                how push notifications can be used. The browser would also be able to 
                automatically prompt the user to install the PWA. The improved performance 
                from the PWA also helps to increase search engine traffic.
