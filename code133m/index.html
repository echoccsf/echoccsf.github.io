                Progressive Web Applications &#40;PWAs&#41; are web applications that can be
                installed onto a device to be usable offline. They are created with the goal
                of being quicker loading than a traditonal web application. PWAs are able to
                load instantly&#44; so that the user won&#39;t have a less-than-optimal 
                experience while they&#39;re being used. Since over half of internet users tend 
                to abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to use&#44; the instant loading 
                proves vital if they want to receive enough views.

                Along with reliability&#44; PWAs also don&#39;t need to have a specific app store
                to be installed onto the device. Through manifest files&#44; PWAs can also give
                developers control on how the application appears once loaded, including how any
                push notifications can be used. The browser would also be able to automatically 
                prompt the user to install the PWA. On top of that&#44; the improved performance 
                from the PWA also helps to increase search engine traffic.
