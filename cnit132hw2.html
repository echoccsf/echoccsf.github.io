            <li>Use description meta tag in the head of the HTML document.</li>
            <li>Use heading tags where they make sense to emphasize emportant text.</li>
            <li>Make sure content is created around primary and relevant secondary keywords.</li>
            <li>Use alt text to get images to be more descriptive, distinctive and relevant.</li>

        <p>Unique page titles containing relevant words in the meta tags and headings will make it easier for others to find your website on a search engine. It is also highly suggested to add in relevant images and accompanying alt text to describe the content of your website.
