            <p>Welcome to my home page. I am born and raised in San Francisco. I have been interested in computers at a young age, and I have been the tech expert in my family since that time. I enjoy taking apart electronic devices to see their inner workings and putting them back together. I believe there are so many things to learn from computers and that we can never be too late to start learning new things, especially about computers.</p>
        
            <p>I am a college graduate, but I was initially going to pursue a healthcare related profession. Due to the intense competition in healthcare, I decided to switch my career goals to a computer related profession since I do have interest in computers. In terms of web development, I have been coding for around 2 to 3 years on and off, but I am still open to other computer related fields while maintaining my coding skills. One of my favorite websites that deals with computers is the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCMag Website</a>. This website is one of my favorite websites because it has everything you need to know about computers and technology. It even does reviews on computers and electronics, as well as some tips on how to do various things that deal with computers and electronics. Although this website didn't influence me to learn about web development, but it does reinforce my interest in computers.</p>
        
            <p>This article at Techopedia mentions a bit about the start of <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web development in the 21st century</a>. This section of the article offers a very brief but important context of how web development came to be in the present time. Despite the advances made from the beginning of this century to the present day, there are still many improvements that are being made to keep web development relevant in the world.</p>

            <ul>
                
                <li>My first recommended website is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a> because it offers simple tutorials and tips on how to code correctly. It is also my first go-to location for coding help.</li>
                
                <li>My next recommended website is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Docs</a> because it offers descriptive tutorials and tips on web development.

                <li>Although I don't use this website as often, I also recommend <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a> because developers often come here to find answers to questions that other coders may have previously asked when they needed help.</li>
