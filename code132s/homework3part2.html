    <h1>Analytics Report</h1>
    <a href="reportemeryanalytic.pdf">Analytics Report on Emery's Website</a>
    <p>This report is the Event count by Event name report in the Enegagement category. The
        event types represented invlude page_view, scroll, user_engagement, session_start,
        and first_visit. There have been 6 total unique users on the website, which is
        represented by the first_visit event. Since I was late in giving access to this 
        website, my number of users is quite low. The page_view event is the most numerous 
        because people just simply accessed the website. The horizontal axis of the left side 
        graph shows the days in which events occur, while the same graph's vertical axis 
        shows the number of events that happened in each day. On the right side graph, the 
        dots represent the event type. The horizontal axis is the number of such event that 
        occurred, and the vertical axis is the number of users that have accessed the website.
        Since the scroll event is somewhat tied into the page_view event, its number is very
        close to that of page_view. The count in session_start goes up whenever the user starts 
        engaging with the website. This number may be low due to it being the count of a 
        continuous session, which may include numerous interactions in the other events.
        The user_engagement event is higher but not as high as the highest numbered events.
        This may be counted each time the page is in focus for at least one second. The
        numberous pages within the website helps a bit with that number. The main thing for
        me to improve on is to give the users enough time to find the website before
        beginning to view the analytics reports.</p>
