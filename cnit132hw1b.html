            I am born and raised in San Francisco. I enjoy computers and the outdoors. I am the technologically savvy person in my family. Taking apart and putting back together electronic devices is interesting.

            Besides the United States, I've also been to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan since these countries are where my parents and their relatives are from. When international travel is less risky to our health, I would like to go traveling all over Europe and maybe a few other Asian countries. Australia or somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere can also have new things to see.

        <ul>
            <li>The Alps (of any European country) for their mountains.</li>
            <li>The Australian Outback for their unique wildlife.</li>
            <li>The busy streets of Tokyo to see life in the world's most populous city.</li>
