    <p>Welcome to my home page. I am born and raised in San Francisco. I have been interested in computers at a young age, and I have been the tech expert in my family since that 
    time. I enjoy taking apart electronic devices to see their inner workings and putting them back together. Other than computers, I also enjoy hiking in parks and checking out new 
    sights. I believe there are so many things to learn from computers and that we can never be too late to start learning new things, especially about computers.</p>
    
    <p>I am a college graduate, but I was initially going to pursue a healthcare related profession. Due to the intense competition in healthcare, I decided to switch my career goals 
    to a computer related profession since I do have interest in computers. In terms of web development, I have been coding on and off since 2016, but I am still open to other 
    computer related fields while maintaining my coding skills.</p>
