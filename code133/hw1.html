            My name is Emery Cho. I was born and raised in San Francisco. I currently deliver
            for the post office. I've been taking various courses in web development and 
            in computer networking on and off since 2016. I have previously attended a coding
            bootcamp for web development, but it's been a few years since doing a good amount
            of web development.
        </p>
         
        <p class="clearfix">
            As mentioned above, one of my reasons to take this course is to review and get a
            refresher of what I've already learned in the coding bootcamp. Another reason to
            take this class is to see if web development is a good potential career for me.
            I also have a fascination about technology, so I would also like to get into
            something that I also enjoy, even though careers in general are far from easy.
            Because of this, I'm also taking other networking and IT courses in CCSF. I hope
            to learn more about web development and anything else that deals with computers
            and technology.
        </p>
